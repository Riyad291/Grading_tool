How to Use
Entering Grades: Fill out the form for each student, entering scores for homework, quizzes, midterm, and final project.
Homework: All five homework scores are averaged, contributing 20% of the final grade.
Quizzes: The lowest quiz score is dropped, and the remaining scores are averaged, contributing 10%.
Midterm: Directly contributes 30%.
Final Project: Directly contributes 40%.
Viewing Final Grades: After submission, the final grade for each student appears on the same page.
Example Calculation
A sample calculation for student John Doe:

Homework (avg): (75 + 89 + 103 + 55 + 100) / 5 * 0.2
Quizzes (avg with lowest dropped): (78 + 99 + 76 + 69) / 4 * 0.1
Midterm: 86 * 0.3
Final Project: 90 * 0.4
The result will be rounded to the nearest whole number.

Additional Information
